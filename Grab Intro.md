Grab Objective of Using OSM	 	
- OSM being an open source project, releases map data in their most raw form, for free with an open license. OSM also has a 
larger community of local and remote volunteers who contribute to the map, which helps enhance the quality of maps. 
Grab would like to be part of the community and help improve the map.
Many places might not be accurate or identifiable on other forms of maps. Having these places  improved by Grab will give richer 
information to OSM mapping contributors.


Goals 
 - Grabâ€™s main focus is to enhance OSM for Southeast Asian countries and specifically in areas served by Grab Taxi.
